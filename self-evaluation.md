# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Some what confident. Need more practice.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Both unproductive and productive struggles. So far the unproductive struggle has been more manageable.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I'd like to go through my notes. Possibly re try the challenges.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Some small technical questions. I am using google and youtube to find answers.
